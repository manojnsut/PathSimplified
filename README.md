# Path Simplified
A web app to find the path between start and end point on the grid using A* algorithm

## A* algorithm

A * algorithm is a searching algorithm that searches for the shortest path between the initial and the final state. It is used in various applications, such as maps.

In maps the A* algorithm is used to calculate the shortest distance between the source (initial state) and the destination (final state).
